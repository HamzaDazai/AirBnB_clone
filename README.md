# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description

The AirBnB clone project is a comprehensive web application that simulates the functionalities of the AirBnB platform. It includes a backend for managing data through a custom command interpreter and a front-end for user interaction. The project allows users to create, update, delete, and retrieve various objects such as users, places, states, cities, amenities, and reviews.

## Command Interpreter Description

The command interpreter serves as the interface for interacting with the backend of the AirBnB clone project. It allows users to execute commands to manage the application's data models. The interpreter reads, processes, and executes commands from the user, providing a convenient way to manipulate the stored data.

## How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:
   ```sh
   cd AirBnB_clone

## How to Use the Command Interpreter

Once the interpreter is running, you can use various commands to interact with the data models. Here are some basic commands and their descriptions:

- **create [class name]**: Creates a new instance of a specified class.
- **show [class name] [id]**: Displays the details of an instance based on its class and ID.
- **destroy [class name] [id]**: Deletes an instance based on its class and ID.
- **all [class name]**: Displays all instances of a specified class. If no class is specified, it shows all instances of all classes.
- **update [class name] [id] [attribute name] [attribute value]**: Updates an attribute of an instance based on its class, ID, and the new value.

## Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating how to use the command interpreter:

**Create a new user:**
```sh
